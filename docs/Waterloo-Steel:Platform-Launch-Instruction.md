# 1. Power On

## 1.0 External Network with Ethernet

### 1.0.a [Optional] Connect Ethernet to WAN from Router LAN

- if you want internet access (eg, update local repository), please connect to:
  - WAN port of the robot <-----> LAN port of the Router

### 1.0.b [Optional] Connect Ethernet to LAN to Laptop Ethernet Port

- if you want Remote access with **AnyDesk** to the robot network,
  - you may want your PC connecting to the Lab Wifi
  - and connect the ethernet from robot LAN to Laptop

## 1.1 Powering on the robot

### 1.1.1 Turn on the robot by twisting power knobs for Base

- we should see the green button (for jetson pc) is lighting on
- fan spinning, and everything should be powered except WAM

### 1.1.2 Turn on the robot by twisting power knobs for WAM

- Make sure the LED panel is powered on, and will show ERROR as the WAM has not been calibrated and launched by default

### 1.1.3 Power on the steam deck controller, and connect to the Robot Wifi `UWARL_171102_5G`

- We should be able to launch the controller

### 1.1.4 Launch the Controller on Steam Deck:

1. Launch the joystick controller by touching **[Launch UWARL Summit Controller]** App Icon

   - üö® If the controller app quits after launching,  [[A.1 Deck Controller Cannot Launch:](#A1-Deck-Controller-Cannot-Launch)]
   - **[OPTIONAL]** :notebook: You may launch the rviz by touching **[Launch Rviz]** App Icon

> üìì Icon apps are installed by `uwarl-robot_config` toolchain, and allow us to use the basic interface without keyboard.

![deck_controller_desktop](resources/deck/deck_controller_desktop.jpg)

- :one:  > **Launch Pad** 
- :two:  > **Rviz Viewer**

# 2. Power Off

## 2.1 Power off Robot Sequence ‚ÄºÔ∏è 

> :warning: If possible, ssh into the jetson and summit PC to shutdown the PC first
>
> ```bash
> # jetson:
> $ ssh uwarl-orin@192.168.1.10
> # summit:
> $ ssh ssh uwarl@192.168.1.11
> ```

1. Long Press Green Button to power off the **Jetson PC**
2. Turn off the **WAM** power rails 
3. Turn off the **overall power rails** 
4. Turn off the screen of the steam deck by pressing power button briefly once, and put into charger.
   - we dont want a reboot of steam deck



# 3. Waterloo Steel Demo [Jack]

## 3.1 Launching the Camera

```bash
$ ssh uwarl-orin@192.168.1.10
$ roslaunch waterloo_steel_supervisor multi_intel_camera.launch
```

> üö® If the launch is not successful:
>
> 1. Check the hardware USB C cable connections to both cameras
> 2. [Ask Jack if you need to] Launch individual cameras separately for the system to register individual camera IDs

## 3.2 Launching WAM

```bash
# 1. connect to jetson
$ ssh uwarl-orin@192.168.1.10
# 2. start a tmux session
$ tmux 
### TIPS:
# create multiple windows with:
# [ctrl + b] then ["] : split horizontal
# [ctrl + b] then [%] : split vertical
# [ctrl + b] then [arrow-keys] : switch window selection
# [ctrl + b] then [:] and [type: set mouse on] : to enable mouse selection and scroll and window adjustment

# 3. launch wam node:
$ roslaunch wam_node wam_node.launch
### WAM Activation Instruction:
# 1. release all E-stops
# 2. [shift & activate] on control pendant (the one with E-stop inside the cabinet)
# 3. [Enter] on the keyboard to confirm default home-position
# Now, you will hear the gear activating

### TIPS:
# launch other nodes: 1.2 camera & 1.4 demo node in different tmux windows

# 4. detach to keep running in background and independent from your laptop terminal:
# [ctrl + b] then [:] and [type: dettach]
```

## 3.3 Launching Demo Node

```bash
$ roslaunch waterloo_steel_supervisor waterloo_steel_demo.launch
# command to perform demo:
$ rosservice call /waterloo_steel/start_demo "demo_id: 2"
```

## 3.4 Check Demo Rosbag Records:

```bash
$ ls ~/.ros/bagfiles/waterloo_steel_demo/session_{id}/
```



# A. Troubleshoot

## A.1 Deck Controller Cannot Launch:

üö® If the controller app quit after launching, it is likely due to the following issues:

 1.  The deck is not connected to summit wifi "*UWARL_171102A_5G*"

     > üõ†Ô∏è Connect to the wifi manually at the status bar

 2.  The summit is not hardware ready:

     > üõ†Ô∏è Please reset (engage and release) the E-Stop at the rear of the SUMMIT base

 3.  There is no ros core in the network OR any other detailed issues ‚Üí The Summit Base ROS Controller and ROS Core were not launched successfully nor enabled:

     > üõ†Ô∏è Please SSH into the summit base and troubleshoot from there:
     >
     > ```bash
     > # SSH into adlink mxe211 (summit)
     > $ ssh uwarl@192.168.1.11
     > 
     > # check if summit bringup is successful
     > $ systemctl status --user roscorelaunch@waterloo_steel_summit_bringup:waterloo_steel_summit.launch
     > 
     > # [DEBUG] - print out last msg (double-check time-stamp):
     > $ journalctl --follow --user --user-unit=roscorelaunch@waterloo_steel_summit_bringup:waterloo_steel_summit.launch.service > log.txt
     > # [DEBUG] - Live Stream:
     > $ journalctl --follow --user --user-unit=roscorelaunch@waterloo_steel_summit_bringup:waterloo_steel_summit.launch.service
     > 
     > # stop/restart
     > $ systemctl stop --user roscorelaunch@waterloo_steel_summit_bringup:waterloo_steel_summit.launch
     > $ systemctl restart --user roscorelaunch@waterloo_steel_summit_bringup:waterloo_steel_summit.launch
     > 
     > # You may want to check if the workspace is at the right target, and built successfully:
     > $ check_ws_status
     > $ build_ws
     > $ src_all
     > ```
